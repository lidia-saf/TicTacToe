# This is partially solved TIC TAC TOE Tutorial by React

If you have extra time or want to practice your new React skills, here are some ideas for improvements that you could make to the tic-tac-toe game which are listed in order of increasing difficulty:

1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list. (DONE)
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list. (DONE)
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them. (DONE)
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order. (DONE)
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win. (UNDONE)
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw. (UNDONE)

Note that I have done it with skills and ideas I have currently, so it is not as efficient and good as it could be.
